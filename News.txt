While some question those numbers, engineer Michelle Glauser sees a bigger problem. She says many of those bootcamps simply limit their enrollments to people who don't need much more expertise to land a great job, in order to keep those numbers high.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to accept more and more advanced people,\xe2\x80\x9d Glauser says of the coding bootcamp she attended, Hackbright Academy. \xe2\x80\x9cNow they accept people who are either close to a CS degree or just don't have a graduate degree,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat seems messed up to me.\xe2\x80\x9d  Glauser sees her story as different from many of those she saw in her bootcamp experience, and she decided to start her own bootcamp, based on her own experience. She entered Hackbright with almost no coding background\xe2\x80\x94something she thinks is becoming more rare in the for-profit bootcamp industry\xe2\x80\x94and with little funds to pay the school's tuition, which today is $16,570. (Glauser says she and her partner decided to get married as a way to raise money for her to attend, via wedding-gift money.)  Now they accept people who were either close to a CS degree or just don't have a graduate degree... That seems messed up to me.  Michelle Glauser  So she created Techtonica, a nonprofit coding bootcamp based in San Francisco that provides free tech training and job placement specifically for women and nonbinary people in the Bay Area.  She's designing the program for folks who wouldn't typically make it in the coding school she graduated from. \xe2\x80\x9cWe only find our students through [coding] workshops we put on with other community organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn't want to do an open application because I feel like it would be the same people who already have connections and privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  The program, which launched earlier this year, doesn't require any background in tech from its applicants. It's longer than most for-profit coding programs\xe2\x80\x94six months, rather than the three or four common in the industry. Also unlike most bootcamp providers, Glauser is creating a business model where companies sponsor a student (to the tune of around $15,000), which covers both instructor costs and living stipends for students. Advocates also receive diversity training for their companies, and provide a mentor to the students in the program. Around the fifth month of the program, Glauser says the plan will be for mentors to get to know the students and recruit at least one for their company.  The 10 students that Techtonica is recruiting for its upcoming cohort don't all yet have promises of employment from corporate partners\xe2\x80\x94Glauser says three partners are on board so far\xe2\x80\x94but her goal is to find a job placement for all of them by the end of the program. And later, to follow up and check in on how they are doing in their new work environment.  Techtonica is far from alone in its method of targeting a particular group that is underrepresented in tech, training them (notably, for free), and working with corporate partners to secure jobs and internships for its students.  For instance, MinedMinds, a coding bootcamp program out of Pennsylvania, aims to give former coal miners coding and computer skills. Cofounder Amanda Laucher says the idea for the program came out of \xe2\x80\x9cmy brother [who] wanted to get a job in tech, but he couldn't get a 4-year degree,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe also couldn't leave his family to go to a big city and pay $12,000 to $20,000 in tuition for a bootcamp.\xe2\x80\x9d  So Laucher and her partner took it upon themselves to give him some basic coding skills. The trainings would grow to become their nonprofit, and she claims that around 80 percent of students who completed the MinedMinds programs landed jobs shortly afterwards. (Some programs MinedMinds helps facilitate are organized through outside institutions like community colleges or companies, making it difficult to track all graduation rates.)  For-profit companies need great outcomes in a short amount of time, so you see more skilled people when you come in.  Michael Street  MinedMinds teaches its cohorts skills in Java, CSS, SQL, and like Techtonica it is also free for students. The nonprofit also puts an emphasis on recruiting students who want a job in tech, but lack basic tech and coding skills. She says they purposefully don't recruit students with a background in tech. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don't want to rule people out, we want to rule them in.\xe2\x80\x9d  Michael Street founded Black Men Code in Atlanta, Ga. with a similar challenge in mind. \xe2\x80\x9cFor-profit companies need great outcomes in a short amount of time, so you see more skilled people when you come in.\xe2\x80\x9d He adds: \xe2\x80\x9cTaking 12 weeks off and paying $15,000 is a much higher risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  Street's nonprofit works with institutions including several HBCUs to offer free tech training to college students in any discipline. Of the students he has worked with, 75 percent have been placed in internships.  Small steps  Street says working with a university\xe2\x80\x94and avoiding a for-profit structure where the market demands quick, impressive job placement results\xe2\x80\x94also lowers the risk attached to bringing in students with no prior experience.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that anyone has aptitude for computer science,\xe2\x80\x9d Street underlines. He says his model is a \xe2\x80\x9cnight and day\xe2\x80\x9d difference from most for-profit bootcamps.  The stated mission of these nonprofit programs are improving economic conditions for people in their own areas. And while that might not reach as many people as a program with campuses across the country, Glauser thinks the small approach has big effects for those in local communities who are sidelined by bootcamp fees and application requirements.  \xe2\x80\x9cI've definitely seen improvement in diversity and inclusion in my five years as a software engineer,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are more programs working on supporting underrepresented people, and the conversations about how to welcome diversity have become much more prevalent.\xe2\x80\x9d'*[]*\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem to accept more and more advanced people,\xe2\x80\x9d Glauser says of the coding bootcamp she attended, Hackbright Academy.

Whether it's your smartphone, computer, or gaming device, without the right software, it would be as useless to you as a paperweight.  That's where software engineering comes in. If you're someone who pays close attention to detail, values the importance of teamwork, and are always excited to learn something new, then a role as a software engineer could be the right fit.  Jump ahead to learn more about the specifics of becoming a software engineer:  What is a software engineer?  As part of the information technology sector, software engineering is an extension of computer science that includes the development and building stages of various types of programs.  What does a software engineer do? A software engineer works to apply mathematical analysis and the overall principles of computer science to design and develop computer software. This could include anything from operating systems, computer games, business applications, network control systems, and more.  As a software engineer, you'll have extensive knowledge about programming and coding, design and architecture, algorithms and data structures, how to debug and test software, and more.  Thanks to the increasing advancement in mobile technology, the role of a software engineer is in high demand. But first, you need to know where to start.  Software engineer degree  The first step in embarking on a career as a software engineer is to get a bachelor's degree in computer science, software engineering, computer programming, mathematics, or a related field. Bachelor's degree programs for a software engineer will focus on digital logic, algorithm design, data structures, project planning, and a structured approach to programming.  Courses related to software development will center around computer programming, while computer security courses will target data security and what to do in the event of a data breach, in addition to the fundamentals of cryptography. There will also be courses that focus on project management and user interface.  During your time as a student, you'll want to learn to code. It's in your best interest to develop a comprehensive knowledge of programming, software, architecture, and software testing. Some coding languages you'll want to be familiar with include:  Related: In our tech-driven world, find out why it's more important than ever that you learn to code.  A great way to learn some of these languages would be to either enroll in a coding bootcamp program or to pursue an internship. Doing so will also allow you to choose a specialization before you start applying for jobs, as there are many directions you can go once you get your degree.  Some examples include:  Software engineer jobs  One of the great aspects of wanting to become a software engineer is that when it comes to your title, they come in various shapes and sizes.  Some popular job titles include:  Junior software engineer  Lead/Senior software engineer  Lead software development engineer  Web developer  Junior web developer  Technical architect  Principal software engineer  Programming analyst  Application development  Chief technology officer  Those looking to become a software engineer can experience growth and opportunities in a multitude of industries, not just the tech industry. For instance, see what industries like healthcare, automotive, nonprofit, government, and finance have to offer someone with the skills to be a software engineer.  Did you know: The software engineer job market is expected to grow by 30.7% between 2016 and 2026. (Source)  Software engineer job duties  No matter the industry or job title, a software engineer is likely to have specific duties they are responsible for day in and day out.  Some of these duties include: Working with others to determine software needs  Designing, developing, and testing a system or application based on specifications  Creating diagrams and models to help developers build the code needed for the system or application  Maintaining the system or application with updates and fixes when necessary  Recommending software updates for existing systems and applications  Working with developers and other engineers to build software  As a software engineer, you'll work with a client and assess their needs, then design, test, and develop computer software to meet those needs with other members of the team.  Software developer vs. software engineer  There can be some confusion as to the difference between a software developer and a software engineer. The main difference between these two roles is the actual job function.  A software engineer will apply engineering principles to create software. Because of this, software engineers take part in software development by connecting the needs of the client with technological solutions.  A software developer is responsible for the entire development process, as well as the driving force behind the programs. Their job is to work with the client to create the design and then the computer programmers to develop the code needed to run the software.  A software engineer is involved with the development process, but a software developer will rarely be involved in the engineering process. When one is overseeing the engineering portion, the other is focusing on creating functional programs.  Software engineer salary  The salary of a software engineer is going to depend on your actual job title, the company you work for, and how much experience you have. In the United States, the average salary for a software engineer is $92,824 a year.  According to ComputerScience.org, on average, the typical ranges for software engineers are:  Entry-level (0-5 Years) $77,000 Mid-level (5-10 Years) $91,000 Experienced (10-20 Years) $102,000 Late career (20+ Years) $110,000  Best paying cities for software engineers  There's no denying that the role of a software engineer is in high demand, but do you live in a city where they'll pay you the most to be one? Here are the top five best cities to become a software engineer:  As more companies recognize the need for this position, this list is likely to change. Before you pack up and move, check out what your city has to offer.  Software engineer tips from the experts  No matter what career you're interested in, it's always a good idea to get some advice from those already in the field. We asked four experts and this is the advice they'd pass on.  Develop a passion early  \xe2\x80\x9cI started learning to write code as a teenager on our family Apple II+. The first language I learned was Applesoft Basic, and I read books and magazines and copied that code into the computer. When it worked, it was amazing! When it didn't, it was a puzzle to figure out why. I was hooked.  When I went to college, I didn't study computer science. I didn't see software engineering or software development as a career, so I graduated with a degree in liberal arts instead. Once I got out of college, I took a mainframe programming job and my title was statistician, but it would now be called a data analyst. I liked working there, but when the web became a thing, I knew it was my true calling.  Since then, I've been doing custom software engineering, developing, and consulting since the mid 1990s. I don't have any regrets about the way my career unfolded. I sometimes wonder how it would have been different with a CS or MIS degree. But the job of a consultant is to understand the customer's problems, think critically, explore all the options, and make a recommendation. My degree prepared me for all the non-coding aspects of my work. People think we spend all day writing code, and some do, but most spend a significant amount of time trying to better understand and work through business problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  - Joe Wilson, owner of Volare Systems  Make the most of your resources  \xe2\x80\x9cAll resources for learning how to code are available for free online. Software engineering and development communities are very open and helpful. Many people will eagerly share their expertise with others. It's one of the things that characterizes this community.  Now that I know this, if I could do it all again, I would not have gone to the online bootcamp but would rather start researching the materials on my own. But then again, I probably wouldn't know what I was doing at that time without the experience I have today.\xe2\x80\x9d  - Daria Marczak, Front End Developer at Netguru  Become a Yes Man  \xe2\x80\x9cThroughout my experience, I've learned that it's important to be a Yes Man (or woman). That is: say yes to everything you possibly can and provide reasonable expectations for what it will take. Everything is possible but not everything is profitable. Finally, I've learned that on the other side of being passionate about something, is being self-disciplined.  Self discipline is the difference between a coding statesman and a script kiddie. If I was going to do things differently, I'd be less stressed about where I wanted to be, and be more inclined to sit tight and lean in.\xe2\x80\x9d  - Dan Holmes, DevOps Engineer at Arc  Consider the freelance route  \xe2\x80\x9cI've mostly worked as a freelance engineer and app developer. One of the benefits of working freelance is that you can jump from project to project. Especially short term projects (1-3 months) allow you to gain experience with a particular technology or stack, after which you move on to the next opportunity. You can find out what you like more quickly, or quickly improve a diverse set of skills.\xe2\x80\x9d  - Reinder de Vries, Founder of Learn App Making  If you build it, they will come  When it comes to our favorite products, the difference between hardware and software can make all of the difference. As a software engineer, you'll find it rewarding to be able to build the type of software that makes radical improvements to people's lives.

As a point of reference, in 2018 there were about 93,000 undergraduate computer science majors graduating from American universities.  A key finding shows that online coding boot camps are growing even than in-person bootcamps in growth around 171% year-over-year. However, by sheer count, in-person graduates still dominate \xe2\x80\x94 17,524 vs. 5,519 in 2019.  As a trend alert, Course Report indicates that 29 bootcamps will teach an additional 22,549 students via 995 corporate training partners.  Additional key findings highlight that:  In 2019, there are 96 in-person bootcamp providers and 14 online bootcamp providers. As of June 1, there are coding bootcamps in 71 U.S. cities and 38 states.  Average tuition price of qualifying in-person courses is on the rise \xe2\x80\x93 $13,584, with an average program length of 15.1 weeks. Online bootcamps are slightly less expensive ($12,898) and much longer (24.3 weeks).

Trend Alert: 23 bootcamps offer Deferred Tuition or Income Sharing Agreements in 2019.  This year, Full Stack JavaScript continues to be the most common teaching language, used in 44% of Web Development courses.  The length of online programs has stretched out, from 15.4 weeks in 2018 to 24.3 weeks in 2019. This rise in duration is attributed to the launch of six-month programs in 2018 by online operators such as Lambda School and Thinkful.'*[]*A key finding shows that online coding boot camps are growing even than in-person bootcamps in growth around 171% year-over-year.

Some made splashy announcements with their training initiatives and a number of localized grants and programs launched in an effort to fight persistent skills gaps.  To prepare employees for massive job change, these efforts will need successful models to build on. Effective models are exactly why Trilogy Education\'s rapidly growing coding boot camp model won HR Dive\'s 2019 award for best employee initiative.  Bridging skills gaps  A key element of building successful learning and development programs is anticipating an organization\'s future needs, experts told HR Dive earlier this year. And by several measures, coding skills are a key aspect of future strategy for organizations across the board.  Early 2019 data from LinkedIn show that among the five most in-demand skills on the platform, three involved aspects of programming and/or coding: cloud computing, artificial intelligence and UX design.  These types of jobs play directly to the strengths of Trilogy, a brand of education technology company 2U, which has partnered with several high-profile higher ed institutions to launch boot camps for adult learners in the past year.  "Employers are beginning to recognize that intensive, instructor-led boot camps are an effective way to provide the transformative learning that enables people to transition into critical new roles," Greg Calverase, chief operating officer at Trilogy, told HR Dive via email.  Trilogy coding boot camp programs launched in conjunction with Johns Hopkins University, the University of Oregon and the University of Connecticut, among others. The company also announced boot camps for other subjects, including two focused on fintech in partnership with Columbia University and Rice University. It says more than 3,000 employers employ graduates of its programs.  "In any given city across the country, the local university is often recognized as one of the most respected and impactful institutions," Calverase said. "They have an important role to play in helping their communities prepare for the new skills that employers require in an increasingly tech-driven economy."  Programming successful training  Part of the success behind the company\'s expansion is its focus on what matters most to the given geographic area each of its programs serves. For example, Baltimore, the area in which Trilogy\'s partnership with Johns Hopkins is located, had some 36,000 jobs requiring at least some coding ability go unfilled in 2018, the company said.  "The more important trend is that jobs are changing, and they\'re changing drastically," Calverase said. "For example, financial services professionals increasingly need to become advanced data scientists. Marketing professionals need to know how to code. Even if they aren\'t practitioners, workers in nearly all industries and professions benefit from a baseline knowledge of technology and data analytics."  Trilogy ensures a feedback loop is open to all of its students, who answer a set of questions each week about the pace of their course, the knowledge of their instructor, their feeling of mastery over that week\'s material and whether they feel supported in class, Calverase said. The company uses that data to make sure no one slips through the cracks.  "We\'ve collected over 3 million data points from the student surveys that have helped us make over 700,000 curricula enhancements," Calverase said. "Anything we improve based on learnings at one university immediately helps improve the experience of students in hundreds of classrooms around the world."'*['Ryan Golden', 'Share It']*b"This year, employers came together with partner organizations ranging from governments to universities to nonprofits in the quest to boost employee development.

These individuals have become emblematic of the idea that a degree doesn't define you, and they're often touted by aspiring tech dudes as their inspiration for diving into the fray.  The problem is the obvious lack of diversity on that list.  Growing up in the Bay Area, I found that there were far fewer high-profile examples of women who had diverged from their academic path to find success in tech. I was only a year and a half away from earning two liberal arts degrees, in economics and psychology, at Barnard College of Columbia University when I took the introductory computer science course that ultimately altered my career path.  This course sparked my curiosity in computer science and led me to explore a subject I'd never previously been encouraged to pursue. While it was too late to change majors, I'd finally found a technically complex, creative, and mentally stimulating job\xe2\x80\x93in an entirely different industry than the ones for which I was trained. Despite having no clear path forward, I decided to pursue my new passion. Looking back, I'm so glad I did.  Today, I'm a software engineer at JPMorgan Chase & Co., and I love the work I do every day. Getting here wasn't easy, but I'm proud of how far I've come. If you find yourself in a similar position and want to take the plunge into tech without a computer science-related degree, this is how I did it.  Take a coding boot camp  After discovering my passion for coding during an introductory class, I knew it was too late to pivot my collegiate efforts away from my dual major in economics and psychology. Instead, I applied to an immersive summer boot camp at Fullstack Academy of Code, which helped me develop the necessary skills to become a full-stack software engineer outside of my university's academic term.  These boot-camp-style programs are incredibly useful for honing functional skills, building a portfolio, and connecting with other aspiring tech professionals. During my time at Fullstack Academy, I got tons of hands-on experience building apps and writing code. Rolling up my sleeves and diving into this work further solidified my interest in pursuing software engineering as my full-time career.'*[]*Every software engineer can name college dropouts who went on to do incredible things in the tech world: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Michael Dell, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey.

In the past five years, startups offering these programs have raised millions in investment and won praise from policymakers as an innovative way to prepare (or retrain) workers for the jobs of the digital future.  The enchantment around the model appears to be wearing off, though. In July, Dev Bootcamp, one of the largest and earliest coding bootcamp providers, announced it would close because leaders could not find a sustainable business model. Just a few days later, another pioneer in the space, the Iron Yard, said it would also shut down this year.  Despite their high-tech subject matter and slick Silicon Valley messaging, most bootcamps take a decidedly old-fashioned approach to instruction\xe2\x80\x94focusing on in-person classrooms and high student-to-faculty ratios. But because they lack accreditation, their students aren't eligible for federal financial aid. \xe2\x80\x9cWe've determined that we simply cannot reach a sustainable business model without compromising our mission of delivering a high-quality coding education that remains accessible to a diverse population of students,\xe2\x80\x9d leaders of Dev Bootcamp said in their farewell statement. The statement from Iron Yard cited \xe2\x80\x9cchallenges of a nascent market\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe demands facing all institutions in the higher education marketplace.\xe2\x80\x9d  That doesn't mean the rest of the bootcamps are doomed. In fact, there are at least 95 other coding bootcamp companies in the U.S., and some say they are still growing. But it should bring a dose of realism to what had been a narrative of unending growth and the idea that somehow boot camps were a silver bullet for what ails higher education.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem with education is that we keep coming back to this one-size-fits-all approach,\xe2\x80\x9d says Adam Enbar, CEO of Flatiron School, who insists that he's seeing \xe2\x80\x9cmore demand than ever\xe2\x80\x9d for his company's programs. Rhetoric around coding schools has suggested that they present an easy way to teach anyone to code, regardless of background. Flatiron, he says, has crafted its main program to be highly selective, and it runs a longer program with a different curriculum for those with less familiarity with coding. \xe2\x80\x9cThere's no model that fits everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. And by the same logic, he says, no one can make a blanket statement that bootcamp programs as a group can't work.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we really see in these bootcamps is a lot of career changers,\xe2\x80\x9d says Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report, which researches and runs reviews of coding bootcamps. While there's plenty of talk these days of retraining blue-collar workers for \xe2\x80\x9cnew collar\xe2\x80\x9d jobs in tech, that hasn't been the norm at coding bootcamps. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven't talked to a ton of coal miners who have done a bootcamp and become developers.\xe2\x80\x9d More typical, she says, is someone who already holds a college degree and wants to move from the marketing department of a high-tech firm to the development team.  Jessica Dembe is a good example. She graduated from the Iron Yard's D.C. campus in January, seeing it as a \xe2\x80\x9chigh-risk, high-reward gamble\xe2\x80\x9d that the training would let her jump a few rungs in her career ladder. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn't making a lot of money at my old job\xe2\x80\x9d as a research assistant at a consulting firm, she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, If I could make this work, I could make a good deal more in a new position.\xe2\x80\x9d So she saved up roughly six months' worth of living expenses and quit her job, thanks in part to support from a parent, and enrolled in the three-month program, which cost her about $12,000 after a diversity scholarship and a discount.  She says she did her homework before plunking down that kind of cash. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first I was really skeptical about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of the bootcamp idea. For a few months she tried teaching herself with free online resources, and she even attended a hackathon for people trying to learn coding, but felt she wasn't getting what she needed. A mentor at work had completed the Iron Yard program and recommended it, and she sought out other graduates to see if it had helped them land the kind of job she wanted. \xe2\x80\x9cI don't make rash decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d she jokes.  Dembe was \xe2\x80\x9cshocked\xe2\x80\x9d to learn the school was now closing, but she's happy she went\xe2\x80\x94after all, she found a job six weeks after graduation. If the bootcamp business was so precarious, though, she wonders why the schools often occupy pricey real estate: The campus she attended was just a few blocks from the White House, for instance.  When making their pitch to students, coding bootcamps don't usually talk about amenities. They often stress one number: job placement rates. Several bootcamp companies have joined efforts to independently verify the percentage of students who get jobs in the field soon after graduating, such as the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting, formed by a group of bootcamps, and a broader quality-control framework proposed by Entangled Solutions, a consulting firm.  Neither Dev Bootcamp nor the Iron Yard joined such efforts, as their competitor Flatiron School is quick to point out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey just weren't releasing transparent data,\xe2\x80\x9d says Enbar. The Flatiron CEO isn't part of the CIRR or Entangled framework, either, but says the company releases independently-verified employment rates. \xe2\x80\x9cThe line is being drawn around quality,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.  Another giant in the space, General Assembly, believes success will come down to the strength of providers' relationships with employers to create a reliable pipeline to employment. \xe2\x80\x9cOur vision was never, \xe2\x80\x98Let's build a bootcamp,' \xe2\x80\x9d says Jake Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of General Assembly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea was: Can we build a new way to think about people's careers and how to build people's careers?\xe2\x80\x9d  Some evidence suggests that many employers aren't yet convinced of the educational merits of coding bootcamps. A report in Bloomberg in December even suggests a bootcamp diploma could be seen as disqualifying.  Back when Dev Bootcamp was flying high, one of its co-founders, Dave Hoover, gave an interview to a networking site for entrepreneurs that inadvertently betrayed a dirty little secret of the coding bootcamp model. He said the most valuable advice a mentor gave him at a startup he worked for was:  You don't need to know everything. What you need to do is be the guy who knows how to find the answer. That was eye-opening because it made me realize, especially as a software developer, you don't have to know everything, but thanks to Google and search technology and all the online resources we have, the answers are just a few seconds away.  Some academic critics of bootcamps argue that the companies represent a shift to requiring workers to pay more of the bill for their own training, and one that falls disproportionately on low-income or underrepresented groups. Tressie McMillan Cottom, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of Lower Ed: The Troubling Rise of For-Profit Colleges in the New Economy, recently made that argument on her blog: \xe2\x80\x9cBootcamps are a tax paid by suitably credentialed workers who do not have enough capital (economic, social, or cultural) to enter a high status field of work in which some job is undergoing an actual or projected short-term demand bubble,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote.  Bootcamp leaders often take pains to distance themselves from an earlier generation of for-profit education providers like Corinthian Colleges, which shuttered after a federal investigation found that the company misrepresented to students the percentage of graduates who landed jobs. But legacy for-profit players had pushed into the nascent bootcamp space: In fact, Dev Bootcamp was acquired by Kaplan in 2015, and the Iron Yard had been purchased that same year by Apollo Education Group\xe2\x80\x94which also owns University of Phoenix. (Disclosure: Graham Holdings Co., which also owns Kaplan, is an investor in EdSurge.)  The lasting legacy of education bootcamps may end up being found on traditional campuses. Several colleges are trying the bootcamp approach, even in other fields like health care and political science. In fact, many upstart coding schools are now partnering with those old-fashioned campuses they were intent on replacing.'*[]*Coding bootcamps were supposed to be the next big thing in higher education, promising a compressed, career-focused alternative to traditional graduate school. In fact, there are at least 95 other coding bootcamp companies in the U.S., and some say they are still growing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we really see in these bootcamps is a lot of career changers,\xe2\x80\x9d says Liz Eggleston, co-founder of Course Report, which researches and runs reviews of coding bootcamps.

For many companies, it's simply not enough to reiterate the fact that they need software developers. Instead, they're taking their own measures. Free coding bootcamps \xe2\x80\x94 often funded by government initiatives or even private companies \xe2\x80\x94 have begun to be viable alternatives to the private institutions that charge often well over $10,000 for the price of admission.  Coding in the Midwest  Meridian, a healthcare company based in Detroit, began to struggle to fill software positions in the past few years. In answer, they partnered with Grand Circus, a computer software training organization with locations in both Detroit and Grand Rapids. They offered a free coding bootcamp for a handful of Detroit residents, promising from the beginning to hire a minimum of six.  Based on the success of the program's first run, the Meridian Bootcamp is getting underway for its second go-round. It is only open to Detroit residents and several other limitations apply for who will be accepted. Applications close on March 12. This year, Meridian promises to hire five of the bootcamp learners.  The partnership between the software trainers and the healthcare group is made possible by Detroit At Work, a city-based training initiative that seeks to foster development.  Meridian's model is typical of free coding bootcamps: a company identifies a need and partners with an existing computer coding instructor to privately train their own talent. Admissions are usually highly selective and class sizes may be small. But for dedicated students, it's a game-changing opportunity.  A similar effort is also underway in Chicago. The iOS Bootcamp has been created as a collaboration between the City Colleges of Chicago and Apple as part of the Everyone Can Code initiative. Applications end on March 5th and the course begins in the first week of April. Like many other free coding bootcamps, the classes are limited in size and applicants will have to pass a more selective screening process.  The bootcamp, as its name suggests, is very Apple-centric. It will focus primarily on Swift, the language in which iOS apps are currently written, along with numerous other leading digital services and products.  Other Forms of Free Coding Bootcamps  Many other free coding bootcamps have begun to adopt other business models as well. Founders and Coders, for example, is a non-profit U.K.-based institution that provides their program to students for free. They generate profit by charging a recruitment fee for businesses looking for skilled professionals and also by performing contract consulting work.  A final notable example would be Ada Developers Academy. Ada provides a free software education to women and \xe2\x80\x98gender diverse people' (their term). Like most of the others, Ada combines coding training with a paid internship to get experience in the workforce. They are based in Seattle, and some scholarships are available. But again, their application process is highly selective. Ada receives a good deal of its funding from Third Sector New England.  As with each of the cases above, the class size is small and the screening process is far more rigorous compared to a for-profit coding bootcamp charging a hefty tuition. But the growing number of these programs that step outside of the for-profit education model that has come to dominate programming education is promising.  Coding bootcamps, for the most part, do not need to receive an accreditation as a higher education institute. They do not benefit from public funding and do not need to make their operations transparent. As a result, they do not receive the same oversight. And this can lead to some dubious tactics to get paying learners in the door.  For example, many coding bootcamps promise pretty remarkable success rates for their graduates. But as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, these success rates usually don't give a full accounting of where their graduates are at. Book-cooking tactics can range from some questionable fine print to outright cherry picking.  Free coding bootcamps march to a different beat. Their goal is to hire talent, not to turn a profit. Making a bootcamp free, therefore, goes a long way toward knocking down barriers of entry. It's not just about the cost.'*[]*They offered a free coding bootcamp for a handful of Detroit residents, promising from the beginning to hire a minimum of six.

The complete guide to 24 coding bootcamps  Not that long ago, if you wanted to kick-start a career as a software developer, you\'d probably have to hunker down for the long haul and earn a bachelor\'s degree in computer science, software engineering, computer information systems, or maybe math.  Today, however, you have another option\xe2\x80\x94a coding bootcamp, a training program aimed at teaching you the skills employers value.  In recent years, coding bootcamps have become increasingly popular, mainly because they\'re built around the notion that anyone can learn how to code. This idea appeals to individuals looking for an alternative to spending tens of thousands of dollars on a traditional four-year college education.  Full-time coding bootcamps usually last anywhere from six to 40 weeks, with the average being a little over 12 weeks. Prices typically range from $10,000 to $24,000. Some bootcamps offer a guarantee of a developer job, and if you don\'t land one, you don\'t have to pay anything except your initial deposit.  In comparison, the average cost for an out-of-state bachelor\'s program in computer science is $41,992 a year, with an estimated average total cost of $167,968 for four years. The average total cost per year for a two-year computer science program is $20,784 annually, and $41,568 for two years.  [ Get up to speed on quality-driven development with TechBeacon\'s new guide.

You might also want to consider a coding bootcamp if you\'re looking to transition into a new career as a software developer and you don't have any coding skills. Individuals come to coding bootcamps from diverse backgrounds, such as finance, humanities, marketing, graphic design, natural sciences, teaching, and the performing arts.  Although some employers prefer to hire tech workers with degrees in computer science, 72% of employers say that candidates who have been graduated from coding bootcamps are "just as prepared" to be high performers as those who hold four-year computer science degrees, according to a survey by job site Indeed.  Part of the reason may be that coding bootcamps teach the high-impact skills you\'ll need to be a successful developer in the real world, and they do it in a relatively short time. For example, you\'ll learn coding languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Ruby; web development frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, and Express.js; servers and hosting; databases; and version control tools.  Some caveats  Bootcamps aren\'t for everyone. For one, they\'re not an ironclad guarantee of a job or long-term career, even though most of the programs below claim pretty impressive rates for placing their graduates. Not all bootcamps measure placement rates the same way, and the numbers can be misleading.  Some employers simply don\'t have the bandwidth or desire to take on absolute newbies, whether from university or bootcamp.  Before you begin, make sure this is really something you want to do. It\'s not about just the money you\'ll spend on the program: Are you really cut out to be a developer? It\'s a career path and, like any other, has its ups and downs. Read about other people\'s journeys to see if it\'s something that excites you.  And yes, you really need to want it. To survive a 12-week (or longer) program, you\'ll need to work extremely hard and immerse yourself in the long days and nights of learning, frustrations, and successes. (They\'re not called "bootcamps" for nothing.)  Finally, remember that many successful developers have been self-taught. (Jennifer Dewalt, the founder of Zube, took this route.) This is admittedly a much tougher road, with you having to figure out what to learn and how to learn it. But it can be done.  [ Get up to speed with TechBeacon\'s Guide to Software Test Automation. Plus: Get the Buyer's Guide for Selecting Software Test Automation Tools ]  The types of bootcamps  If you do decide to pursue a bootcamp, here\'s what you need to know.  Full-time coding bootcamps come in a couple of flavors: in-person and online.  In-person  These are usually 10- or 12-week intensive programs that require you to physically attend class and code full time. Most in-person bootcamps operate the same way as traditional schools, with a teacher and some assistants instructing students how to code. Most bootcamps keep class sizes small.  If you opt for an in-person bootcamp, you\'re also likely get homework\xe2\x80\x94coding assignments that you need to complete in a certain amount of time.  In these programs you\'ll learn the skills you'll need to land a job as a developer. However, most in-person coding bootcamps require that you spend at least 40 hours a week in class and another eight hours a week or more completing homework assignments.  That means you won\'t be able to work full time, and you'll have to find other ways to generate income, such as applying for a student loan that also covers expenses. Additionally, if you have a hard time sticking to set schedules, this type of program might not work for you.  Online  These are pretty much the same as in-person coding bootcamps, just totally online. They provide self-learning guides and a mentor-driven, one-on-one teaching style. You can work with your mentor and focus on the skills that will help you get a job as a software developer.  By enrolling in an online coding bootcamp, you won\'t have to quit your job and lose three to five months of income. On the downside, you\'ll have to be disciplined enough to fit this into your work schedule.  Choosing a bootcamp  Before you enroll in a coding bootcamp, in-person or online, it\'s important to have a clear understanding of the skills you'll likely gain if you attend. That will help you determine if a particular bootcamp will help you reach your goals. You shouldn\'t sign up for a program until you\'ve researched all the bootcamps and you can answer these questions:  Will the coding bootcamp help you reach your personal and professional coding goals?  Will you be able to build real-world apps both on your own and as part of a development team?  Can you afford the total cost of the coding bootcamp? (These include tuition and, for in-person programs, living expenses.)  After you\'ve done your due diligence, take some time to review your notes and compare your top choices. The only thing left to do is pick the one that\'s right for you.  The data we collected  We emailed two dozen bootcamp companies and asked each one 19 questions about their programs:  What courses are offered? "Full stack," used by some of the companies to describe their offerings, means a course that covers both the front end (the part the user sees) and the back end (the portion running on servers). Is the program in-person only, online only, or a combination? Where are their US locations? What percentage of students who complete the program are in full-time jobs doing actual programming within six months? Categories such as "contractors" and "freelancers" can mask students actually being out of work. What is graduates\' median starting salary? What is the teacher-to-student ratio for any given class? How much time is devoted to one-on-one interactions between students and teachers? What percentage of the teachers have previously worked as professional programmers full time? How much instruction is handled by teachers\' assistants (TAs)? What is the necessary experience for TAs? What percentage of instructors/mentors and TAs were hired directly after participating in the program themselves, versus working as programmers first? What languages, systems, and tools, including operating systems and hardware, do students learn? What is the course syllabus? (Links are provided below when offered by the companies profiled.) What are the stages of exercises and/or actual application writing? What applications are students required to build? What background is required for the program? Are students put together to do pair programming, a technique used in agile programming so that experienced developers can check one another\'s work? (Note: Some argue that new students may not be ready to effectively use pair programming and that the practice could result in stronger students doing more of the work or two students who know little trying to teach each other.) How many hours a week does the student need to commit to coursework and class time, on average? How long does the program run? How long has this organization publicly offered code bootcamps/courses? How much does the program cost, and when must the fees be paid? Does that include living expenses? What percentage of students complete the program on time?  The answers collected from these emails have been combined to make an excellent resource for anyone exploring which bootcamps to enroll in. However, make sure you perform your own due diligence and contact the programs directly.  You may find that if two providers seem equivalent in terms of raw information, one may ultimately be a better fit once you have a chance to talk with a representative. A good bootcamp should seek to set up a call with you if you apply to enroll.  Here is the data for each bootcamp that responded, in alphabetical order:  1. Actualize  Actualize offers a 100% online, live-over-videoconferencing bootcamp (for all exercises and projects), and an in-person version at its Chicago headquarters.

General Assembly\'s immersive students may team up with other classes or third parties on project-based work.  Hours per week: Students should expect to be in class 35 hours per week (more or less, depending on the course and market-specific regulatory requirements). Homework and project-based work can require an additional three to five hours per day, plus additional weekend work.  Length of program: 10 to 13 weeks, depending on the program  How long has General Assembly been offering bootcamps/courses? Since 2012  Costs: Tuition is between $13,950 and $15,950 for full-time, immersive programs. Students can pay out of pocket, through a loan, through an income-share agreement, or using the Post-9/11 GI Bill. General Assembly also offers scholarships in some markets to qualified candidates who meet need requirements.  Percentage of students completing on time: General Assembly does not offer extensions to the program, so every student who completes the program does so on time. Some students withdraw due to personal reasons, and a small number of students (3.4% of enrollees) do not meet the academic requirements for graduation.  16. Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy  Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy is a women\'s software engineering immersive program that teaches full-stack JavaScript. However, the program itself is co-ed. In other words, Grace Hopper students are not in their own program, but rather integrated into the co-ed Fullstack Academy. (See listing, above.)  The Grace Hopper Program offers a risk-free education: Students don\'t have to pay tuition up front, and if students don\'t find work within a year of graduating, they don\'t pay at all. Students just have to pay their deposits up front.  Courses: Full-time and part-time coding bootcamps as well as prep classes  In person, online, or a combination? Combination; every bootcamp begins with a four-week part-time, online module that helps students develop a shared base of knowledge before beginning the on-campus portion of the program.  US locations: New York and Chicago  Percentage completing program who are in full-time jobs within six months: As of June 2018 (the latest date that data is available), more than 70% of Grace Hopper Program students were employed full time, in the field, within six months of graduation. (Note that Grace Hopper Track students are included in Fullstack Chicago outcomes reports. During this same time period, Fullstack Chicago reported more than 80% of students found full-time, in-field employment within six months of graduation.)  Median starting salary: As of June 2018 (the latest date that data is available), the median annual base salary for Grace Hopper Program grads in their first jobs was $91,000. (Note that Grace Hopper Track students are included in Fullstack Chicago outcomes reports. During this same time period, Fullstack Chicago students reported an annual base salary of $70,000. Note also that numbers do not include benefits and/or bonuses.)  Teacher-to-student ratio: 1:20. Four instructors are available to any one class at any time; two are actively teaching, and two are available for office hours. TAs (called fellows) are also employed for every group, usually one for every seven students.  Time for teacher-student one-on-one: Classtime alternates between lectures and workshops. During workshops, students pair-program, at which time instructors are available for one-on-one and small-group instruction. Instructors are also available for office hours multiple days a week.  Percentage of teachers with full-time programming experience: Note: Grace Hopper Program and Grace Hopper Track share software engineering teaching staff with partner program Fullstack Academy. Some 95% of Fullstack software engineering instructors have previously worked as full-time professional web developers.  How much TA instruction? Necessary experience to be TA? TAs do not lecture. They help students with technical questions during workshops, grade checkpoints, and engage one-on-one with their assigned small groups of students to support them throughout the program. TAs are called fellows and are usually the top students from the previous class. In this way, they already have technical training, and then receive mentoring and operational training from the academic, student experience, and admissions teams.  Percentage of instructors/TAs hired directly out of the program: 95% of Fullstack Academy and Grace Hopper Program software engineering instructors have previously worked as full-time professional web developers. The state of New York, which regulates Fullstack Academy and the Grace Hopper Program, mandates that any program graduate must get two years of industry experience before they can be hired as instructors. All TAs are hired after completing the program, but before officially graduating, which means they\'re not reported as being "hired" until they finish as TAs and get hired elsewhere.  Languages, systems, and tools learned: Full-stack JavaScript using the NERDS stack (Node, Express, React, Databases using SQL), plus HTML, CSS, DOM, Redux, Sequelize, and Thunks. Additional concepts include pair programming, debugging, data structures, testing, and algorithms. Students also learn to use GitHub and are free to explore additional libraries (especially AR/VR) during their two-week final projects.  Course syllabus: Available online  Required student background : A computer science background is not required. Most Grace Hopper students are not computer science graduates, but come instead from diverse backgrounds, such as finance, humanities, marketing, graphic design, natural sciences, teaching, and the performing arts, to name a few. Grace Hopper is not a beginner program; prospective students need to understand the basics before they will be able to pass admissions. The same admissions standards apply to the Grace Hopper Program as to Fullstack\'s software engineering program. Women who are accepted may choose to attend either Grace Hopper or Fullstack, depending on their financial situations and preferred learning environments.  Student-student pair programming? Students pair-program with different classmates each day, switching regularly between driver and navigator. Students report that this style of learning helps them engage with the work and form deep connections with classmates, and grads report that the soft skills developed during pair-programming workshops have ultimately given them a leg up as job candidates.  Hours per week: 10 am to 6 pm Eastern time during junior phase (first six weeks on campus), and 9:30 am to 6 pm Eastern during senior phase (second six weeks on campus). There\'s a 1.5-hour lunch break daily. There is no homework, and each student chooses how she will spend her evenings.  Length of program: 17 weeks; includes a four-week, part-time remote foundations class, plus 13 weeks on campus  How long has the Grace Hopper Program been offering bootcamps/courses? The Grace Hopper Program opened in New York in January 2016, and in Chicago in February 2018.

The fastest way to learn how to code may be through a coding bootcamp. They're intensive, short-term training programs in web and mobile development, design or security.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe see tremendous successes,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mark Smith, managing director of Coding Dojo, a bootcamp with online and on-site campuses around the country. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can take [people] from zero to a developer in 3 1/2 months, if they're willing to put in the effort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Developers \xe2\x80\x94 one of several kinds of jobs that coding bootcamp grads seek \xe2\x80\x94 design and build websites and apps.  Coding bootcamps, similar to many trade schools, are typically run by private, for-profit companies and are offered both in-person or online, depending on the program. Some popular coding bootcamps include General Assembly, Flatiron School, App Academy and Bloc. These are not accredited colleges or trade schools, so they are not eligible for Title IV funding by the federal government or federal student aid.  Though they're not traditional postsecondary programs, they're gaining in popularity: Coding bootcamps graduated an estimated 20,000 students in 2018, according to market research by Course Report, a coding bootcamp review site. Its current count: 95 in-person bootcamp providers and 13 online bootcamps across 44 states.  Here's more information to help you decide if coding bootcamp is right for you.  How long do coding bootcamps take to complete?  The typical in-person coding bootcamp takes less than four months to complete \xe2\x80\x94 14.4 weeks on average, according to Course Report's research. Online bootcamps average 15.4 weeks to finish.  The typical in-person coding bootcamp takes less than four months to complete \xe2\x80\x94 14.4 weeks on average.  Completion rates vary by program, but are generally high. Zip Code Wilmington, a coding bootcamp in Wilmington, Delaware, reports a 93% graduation rate, with 88% of its graduates accepting paid job offers within three months of graduating.  At Coding Dojo, completion rates hover around 90%, Smith says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe put a lot of qualifiers in the application process so we make sure we're getting people who are going to have a successful outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.  What are job prospects like for coding bootcamp grads?  Nearly 80% of bootcamp graduates say they're employed in a job requiring the skills they learned at bootcamp, according to a 2018 survey of coding bootcamp alumni outcomes by Course Report. The median starting salary for those who graduated from a bootcamp was $64,000, representing a 49% increase from their previous salaries.  Job prospects are expected to grow at a faster than usual pace through 2026 among some of the biggest and highest-paying positions that coders enter, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, the bureau also indicates most of these jobs require bachelor's degrees, so a coding bootcamp certification might not be enough to snag a job or earn top salaries.  Web developer jobs, which are generally accessible for coding bootcamp graduates, should see 7% job growth. Median salary in 2018 was $69,430.  Information security analysts plan and execute security measures to protect networks and systems for companies. Job growth is expected to be 28% with a 2018 median salary of $98,350 annually.  Software developers design and create computer programs. Jobs are expected to rise 24%; the 2018 median salary was $105,590 per year.  Computer and information systems managers, aka IT managers, direct everything technology-related for a company. These jobs are expected to grow 12%; median job salary in 2018 was $142,530.  How much do coding bootcamps cost?  Coding bootcamp costs vary by location and whether you attend in person or online. The average tuition for courses in person is $11,906, according to Course Report. Online bootcamps cost around $11,118, on average.  You can pay for a coding bootcamps in multiple ways:  Out of pocket.  A payment plan with the bootcamp.  Scholarships the bootcamp offers, based on merit or need.  Income-share agreements or deferred tuition until you get hired, if the bootcamp has these options available.  Using a personal loan \xe2\x80\x94 a potentially pricey option.  How do I choose a coding bootcamp?  There are many reputable bootcamps available, but like for-profit colleges, there are some bad actors.  These short-term schools all advertise in the same way, promising students jobs right after graduation. They all tout high job placement rates, but the accuracy of these claims isn't always verifiable, according to a 2019 report analyzing the coding bootcamp industry by RTI International, a nonprofit research and technical institute.  \xc2\xbb MORE: Your college choice: How to see if a school is legit  That's because bootcamps are private companies, not accredited schools. It means they're not subject to oversight by the government like traditional colleges are. To that end, many job placement claims made by bootcamps are unaudited, which means the numbers are not verified by a third party.  One of the appeals of coding bootcamps is how quick they are. But a short-term program might not prepare you for jobs that require mastery of certain coding languages or deep expertise in design.  Read online reviews; reach out to alumni via LinkedIn and ask for feedback; and search for any news stories about the bootcamps.  Prospective students should do their research. Start with the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting, a nonprofit that tracks graduation and job outcomes among coding bootcamps. It doesn't include every bootcamp, but you'll see some bigger names there. You can also read online reviews; reach out to alumni via LinkedIn and ask for feedback; and search for any news stories about the bootcamps.  Bootcamps are, in some ways, a jumping-off point to a new career. But your outcome depends on your drive and grasp of the material. As Smith says, successful grads are \xe2\x80\x9cwilling to put in the effort.\xe2\x80\x9d'*['Anna Helhoski', 'About The Author', 'Read More']*The fastest way to learn how to code may be through a coding bootcamp.

Encouragingly, some of these programs aim to bring more women, minorities, veterans and other underrepresented populations into the tech sector.  However, integrating diverse entry-level talent into non-diverse workplaces is far from straightforward. Many bootcamps hit road bumps as they try to build sustainable business models and figure out how to match graduates with job opportunities. In September, Andela, the African tech bootcamp, laid off 400 junior developers, citing market demand for more senior-level engineering talent.  Increasingly, bootcamps are discovering that it takes more than new financing options, job promises and teaching hard technical skills to enable graduates to succeed. Although everyone wants magic solutions that can transform high-school dropouts into Google engineers in six months, this rarely happens. Instead, just as K-12 educators have increasingly recognized the importance of social-emotional learning, the bootcamp sector is slowly recognizing the need to address the underlying conditions that impact a student's ability to learn and succeed in a new career.  To pass technical interviews and survive the first months at a new job, coding chops are not sufficient. Students also need growth mindsets and grit to navigate the disappointment that inevitably comes with being rejected after an interview or receiving critical feedback on a code review. When you're new to an industry, it can be easy to take these experiences personally or feel like you're alone in making mistakes. To help graduates persist, Galvanize, a Denver-based bootcamp operator, intentionally incorporates growth mindset interventions into its curriculum so that students are equipped to realize these feelings are not insurmountable.  Similarly, Adobe worked with consulting firm Paradigm to incorporate growth mindset practices into its apprenticeship program designed to bring candidates from underrepresented backgrounds into engineering roles. According to its open-source playbook, Adobe teaches this so that apprentices can \xe2\x80\x9clearn quickly from their mistakes and build confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d They found that, particularly when apprentices are entering a company where they may have less experience than other engineers and may not be selected for a full-time role after the apprenticeship ends, the approach can help to foster strategies for resilience.  Growth mindset and grit are hardly new concepts, having emerged from the labs of researchers Carol Dweck at Stanford and Angela Duckworth at Penn and entered the zeitgeist in K-12 and higher education, but they can be particularly effective for new hires from nontraditional backgrounds who might experience stereotype threat, or the pressure people face when worrying they will confirm negative stereotypes about their racial, ethnic, gender or cultural group.  Fostering mindsets like resilience and grit can help students overcome some of these challenges. However, the tech industry should be careful not to put the onus for overcoming structural inequity on the shoulders of bootcamp graduates alone. Employers also need to realize that their entire teams should play a role in creating more-inclusive cultures.  It can be incredibly intimidating to enter workplaces staffed with engineers from Carnegie Mellon and Stanford if you've just finished a six-month bootcamp, or if you are a developer in Lagos suddenly brought into a team based in San Francisco. The burden should not be solely on these new hires to fit in or \xe2\x80\x9ccatch up.\xe2\x80\x9d Employers need to be willing to invest in this talent after they hire them\xe2\x80\x94and to recognize that the companies might need to change the way they train managers and onboard teams.  Treehouse, an online coding bootcamp, runs an apprenticeship program that can be a model for how tech companies can take the initiative to make their workplaces more inclusive. The program mandates that any employer receiving apprentices also needs to take part in a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training, which research shows consistently contributes to the retention of new employees.  In the same way that nonprofits like Beyond12 and charter schools like KIPP have realized that it is not sufficient to help first generation students get into college\xe2\x80\x94they also need to support them to succeed once they're enrolled\xe2\x80\x94alternative education providers should be exploring similar wraparound models that keep in touch with graduates after they've landed a job. Financed by employers, these follow-on services could support nontraditional candidates in their first years. Usually, when new hires succeed, so does the company.  The COOP program is a model of what this could look like. In addition to offering training in digital marketing and data analytics, the nonprofit provides participants access to social workers who support nontraditional candidates as they take on tech jobs for the first time. Through one-on-one sessions, the counselors help students navigate the stress and feelings of imposter syndrome that can come when you do not see many other people who look like you in your workplace. The program also features a peer-driven model that brings graduates of the program back to lead training and offer support to current participants.  Employers need to be shifting from a mentality of recruiting rockstars to building enabling environments, where capable individuals from across neighborhoods, cultures and countries can fully contribute. Bootcamps are a good first step to equipping students with technical skills. But if companies want to help people from underrepresented backgrounds achieve economic mobility over the long term, they'll need to make ongoing investments.  This doesn't have to be hard. Employers could take steps like:  Supporting nonprofits like COOP, Project Basta and Braven that offer career support to first-generation college students transitioning to their first jobs  Funding affinity groups within large companies that can offer support to new hires from underrepresented backgrounds  Training managers and teams in practices to build more-inclusive cultures  Building holistic apprenticeship programs that offer on-the-job training and other resources to help new hires feel less isolated as they gain technical skills  Employers would be wise to make these investments. The competition for technical talent is getting tighter. The future lies with companies willing to help the most people produce the most valuable work.'*[]*In September, Andela, the African tech bootcamp, laid off 400 junior developers, citing market demand for more senior-level engineering talent.

Other groups, such as the nonprofit Council on Integrity in Results Reporting, have formed to establish best practices for outcomes reporting in the bootcamp industry, but these also rely on self-reported data and work directly with bootcamp providers and affiliates.  Until now, the only data on these programs and outcomes of attendees have come from industry affiliated groups.  The study, released this week, aims to provide more clarity around what the bootcamp market looks like today. Researchers examined 1,387 online and in-person programs across 48 countries, including 44 U.S. states.  The study found that more than half of these bootcamps are career-preparation programs, while 35 percent are shorter courses that are less focused on helping participants switch careers. Five percent are university-affiliated programs, such as extension school bootcamps that Trilogy Education offers, or a recent partnership between Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Fullstack Academy.  Around the globe, the majority (81 percent) of these programs are focused on computer science, and a large portion (59 percent) teach web development. Seventeen percent teach data science and engineering, and only 2 percent teach information technology or security.  The study found that most coding bootcamp programs available are located in the U.S. and Canada. The majority of these (73 percent) are offered only in-person, while 15 percent are offered completely online, and the remaining offer both options. Most programs offer fewer than 15 programs, with the exception of General Assembly, a giant in the field that offers 115 programs.  Authors of the report broke down what kinds of financial-aid options that coding bootcamps offer. \xe2\x80\x9cFurther limiting efforts to track their growth and effectiveness, bootcamps are unaccredited and therefore are not subject to the same governmental regulations or oversight as other postsecondary institutions\xe2\x80\x94nor are they eligible for monetary support,\xe2\x80\x9d the report says.  Students at coding bootcamps are likely to find a range of financial aid including scholarships, private loans or funding through \xe2\x80\x9can affiliation with state or local government grants.\xe2\x80\x9d  Income-share agreements, a tuition financing model where students pay back a portion of their salary after graduation instead of paying tuition upfront, is another option that some bootcamps offer. But the report found that less than 1 percent of programs do this so far.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough income-based repayment programs among bootcamps have received considerable media attention, they were so rare among bootcamp programs\xe2\x80\xa6 that we did not include those data,\xe2\x80\x9d the report says.  Sticking to the Status Quo  Some bootcamp providers have suggested that their programs could open up pathways to high-paying technology careers for students with nontraditional backgrounds, as well as more women and people of color. However data in the study shows that hasn't been the case.  In today's climate, perhaps the most pressing question centers around access.  Only 1 percent of coding bootcamp graduates are black, according to previous research cited in the report, \xe2\x80\x9creflecting a similar proportion of black employees at major tech companies like Facebook and Google.\xe2\x80\x9d For reference, about 12 percent of the U.S. population is black.  Fifty-nine percent of programs were considered by the researchers to have \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive admissions,\xe2\x80\x9d often requiring existing coding skills or degree requirements to gain entry.  Around 20 percent of the career prep programs are aimed specifically at women, but few (9 percent) are tailoring their outreach to racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in tech. In addition, the report points out that few programs share their student demographics, making it difficult to compare target student populations to who bootcamps actually enroll.  \xe2\x80\x9cThis foundational work has raised many more questions than it has answered,\xe2\x80\x9d the report concludes. \xe2\x80\x9cIn today's climate, perhaps the most pressing question centers around access.\xe2\x80\x9d'*[]*The study, released this week, aims to provide more clarity around what the bootcamp market looks like today.

Coders are in demand and well-paid, but finding the right training can be tough.  Impressive starting salaries make programming jobs particularly enticing. With pay for software developers beginning in the $60,000 to $80,000 range, many people are choosing to get training to pursue a career in tech.  But for young professionals entering school or thinking of making a job change, choosing the right education to become a programmer can be a daunting task. There are traditional four-year degrees to consider, but there are other types of training, too.  In the past several years, coding bootcamps have emerged as fast-track courses on in-demand programming skills, with the promise of preparing students for a career in web development, software engineering and other fields. But they're not necessarily the quick career fix they're made out to be.  Online or in person?  When you're choosing a bootcamp, it's important to think about your learning style, and whether in-person mentorship and guidance are vital to your success as a student. There are also lots of online courses to choose from, which is awesome if you don't live in or near a city.  You might assume online classes would be cheaper, or less intense, but that isn't always the case. Top online coding bootcamps like App Academy can cost $20,000.  Credit: Adobe  Bryce Astille graduated six months ago from Launch School\xe2\x80\x98s online bootcamp. The course lasts six months to a year, and teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby.  Astille said the flexibility of an online program allowed him to work full-time while attending the bootcamp, but the learning curve was steep in the beginning.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt took me a while to understand the basics, because I didn't really have a programming background going into it,\xe2\x80\x9d Astille said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think, in retrospect, it would have been nice to have someone to ask questions to in-person rather than online\xe2\x80\xa6 I ended up doing a lot of side work and Google searching just to understand what people were talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hands-on guidance can make a big difference for beginning coders, said Emily Moench, marketing director at DevMountain, a bootcamp based in Salt Lake City.  \xe2\x80\x9cLearning to code is like learning a foreign language: You can learn a lot from online exercises, but chances are that you'll learn more by immersing yourself in a place where the language is spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d Moench said. \xe2\x80\x9cLearning to code in a classroom with an in-person instructor, surrounded by students learning the same thing, offers a depth to the experience.\xe2\x80\x9d  Look for discounts  For some, coding bootcamp is an attractive option, but costly tuition keeps them away. Thankfully, many bootcamps offer scholarships and financial assistance to their students. Financial aid for women, veterans, recent graduates, parents and people in financial need are available from many programs, and can easily be searched for online.  Amber Tanaka attended a bootcamp through the University of Utah and got a discount because she was working for the school at the time. Without that financial assistance, it would have been almost impossible for her to go, she said.  \xe2\x80\x9cI know I will make that money back once I get a job, but still, the discount was money in my pocket while I dedicated myself to the bootcamp,\xe2\x80\x9d Tanaka said.  How legit are 'employment guarantees'?  Many coding bootcamps offer \xe2\x80\x9cjob guarantees\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 you don't pay for the training until you get a job. This might sound like an opportunity too good to pass up, but it's important to look at the fine print first.  To be eligible for the ultra-popular bootcamp Springboard\xe2\x80\x98s job guarantee, students must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited university, have gotten perfect scores during the bootcamp and apply to at least four job postings per week.  Other programs require students to live near a list of preferred metropolitan areas, which rules out rural students.  Even with so many caveats and hoops to jump through, for students who live in big cities, the effort can be worth it. But it can be tough to stay competitive in the job market with just a bootcamp certificate.  [ICYMI: What to Know About Going Back to School After 25]  Stacking up degrees  In today's tech workforce, a bachelor's degree remains vital to finding employment. So, even though completing a coding bootcamp is more efficient, it might not be the best vehicle for success on its own.  Moench said a bootcamp can supplement a bachelor's degree when it comes to building specific skills and a portfolio, and having both can make a candidate stand out even more.  \xe2\x80\x9cThose who have a bootcamp badge and a bachelor's degree are considered unicorns in our industry, and it can be very appealing to potential employers,\xe2\x80\x9d Moench said.  A quick search on Indeed or any employment website shows that a degree or related experience is still preferred for many computer programming jobs. Though certifications are often accepted, you might not be able to compete if another applicant has a degree in computer science, plus a relevant bootcamp certificate.  The United States Census Bureau found that of the 304,181 people working as computer programmers in 2017, fewer than 3,000 had only a professional degree. But the industry's job market is set to shrink by 7 percent in the next 10 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  \xe2\x80\x9cJob prospects will be best for programmers who have a bachelor's degree or higher and knowledge of a variety of programming languages,\xe2\x80\x9d the BLS website states. \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping up to date with the newest programming tools will also improve job prospects.\xe2\x80\x9d  While coding bootcamps can keep professionals fresh on best practices and program languages, they are by no means a \xe2\x80\x9csilver bullet\xe2\x80\x9d for being hired in a tech field.  Tanaka completed a coding bootcamp after finishing her bachelor's degree in computer science. She is now working as a freelancer while she searches for full-time employment. If it wasn't for both the bootcamp certification and her degree, Tanaka fears it would be harder for her to stand out as an applicant.  \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are really good at coding, like, really, really good, and have been doing it a lot longer than I have,\xe2\x80\x9d Tanaka said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to get to that level since I'm just starting out. I have a long way to go but I think I've got an edge, or can at least compete with people who've been doing coding work for years.\xe2\x80\x9d  When it comes to choosing the right bootcamp for you, it pays off to take time to do the research and be picky. A career in computer programming can be incredibly rewarding, with a strong salary. Finding the right training that can define your job search and work environment is worth the effort. What may seem right for one person might not be right for you.  \xe2\x80\x9cI think, overall, (coding bootcamp was) worth it,\xe2\x80\x9d Astille said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a ton of work, much more than I thought it would be, but I got some skills and tools that are pretty awesome and super helpful for my career.\xe2\x80\x9d'*[]*Are Coding Bootcamps Worth It?

Its offices stand empty and graffiti is plastered throughout the historic building. Dedicated in 1959 in the presence of Queen Elizabeth of Belgium as the Hebrew University's archeology department, it has been home to the Joint, a stalwart 105-year-old, global Jewish nonprofit, since 1974.  But far from a somber signal of decline, the desertion of the building was a joyous occasion for the staff, which marked its temporary exodus by spray painting humorous images and slogans. The organization is taking a year to refurbish its Israel operation's headquarters \xe2\x80\x94 even as it takes on an ever more active role in helping solve the country's growing social welfare needs.  Steering the refitted ship into the future is new JDC Israel CEO, Dr. Sigal Shelach, a 50-something labor market firebrand who rose through the organization's ranks to become the first female head of the nonprofit's Israel wing.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up  Shelach has a trifecta of experience and has worked in academia, the government and non-profit realms. She earned a PhD from Tel Aviv University's Department of Labor Studies, where she specialized in employment and migration. After six years as a Senior Research Fellow at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, Shelach joined the JDC in 2007, where she was swiftly upwardly promoted.  Today, as head of JDC Israel, Shelach commands $116.9 million of the global organization's overall $366 million global budget for 2019.  In an organization-wide letter congratulating Shelach for her newest promotion last year, outgoing American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee CEO David M. Schizer wrote that it \xe2\x80\x9cis appropriate that someone who has advanced the professional status of thousands of women in Israel will be the first woman to lead JDC Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Throughout an hour-long conversation with The Times of Israel, Shelach shared her thoughts on what it means to be a rare female nonprofit leader, and emphasized the need for new, broader partnerships with other groups in the welfare playing field to implement a common vision. Shelach said she sees the JDC as a roundtable that can facilitate conversations between the government, the business sector and Jewish world nonprofits.  In Israel, the JDC serves as the de facto startup nation of welfare and social innovation. Through an innovative approach refined since the 1970s for generating new programs, some two-thirds of JDC pilot programs are picked up by the government after a two-year incubation period. In conversation, Shelach attributed the organization's success to its more holistic, long-term view of what she calls \xe2\x80\x9csocial R&D.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWe can take long breaths. We have a very strong board and a strong arm that brings funds into the JDC, which means that we are less donor-driven. We can study what's going on in the world, we can bring the cutting edge, we can trial it, we can fail,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelach.  Among the key programs continuously dreamed up by the JDC are efforts to bring the poorest populations into the workforce so they may become empowered and independent. The Israeli government, she said, has already taken on a slew of successful programs, which are now ubiquitous across the country, quickly naming day care services for the elderly, women and children centers, employment hubs for ultra-Orthodox and Arab communities.  A new project hitting the streets is adopted from similar programs found in the United States. It involves \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity courts\xe2\x80\x9d that act as rehabilitation centers and remove a burdensome backlog from the justice system. Essentially, explained Shelach, an accused individual must plead guilty to his or her crime to enter into a five-stage program that aims to get the client off the streets and at work. Through the partnership of JDC, the ministries of Justice, Welfare, Internal Security and the Prisons System, there are five such programs in place with plans for more, she said.  Taking a 360-degree approach, the JDC's fingerprints can be found in virtually every echelon and field. But there is one common thread: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we do affects the more vulnerable populations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelach.  Unlike other ideologically driven organizations, one of the trademarks of any JDC program is taking into account the needs of the community it is serving. \xe2\x80\x9cWe're not coming to change them. We're not coming with any agenda. JDC is a very apolitical organization, even religiously,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.  For example, when implementing courses to help ultra-Orthodox women enter the hi-tech community, the JDC also instituted a \xe2\x80\x9ccultural hotline\xe2\x80\x9d where the women, accustomed to a more sheltered lifestyle, could ask rabbis questions ranging from whether it was acceptable to sit next to a male co-worker or even use the company microwave.  Now, said Shelach, some of those first ultra-Orthodox women who received training for entry positions in quality analysis are going back for additional courses to become engineers. Likewise, their husbands are increasingly entering the workforce, with some even having served in the Israel Defense Forces \xe2\x80\x94 an increasing trend that she said she is only recently permitted to discuss.  The following is a condensed transcript of the portion of our conversation in which we discussed how it feels to be a woman in a man's world, and how the next generation, including her three children, will benefit.  The Times of Israel: In the Jewish non-profit world, there are many women who enter the field but there are very few who reach good management positions, not to mention directorial positions. But isn't it true that most of the workers today are female?  Dr. Sigal Shelach: I don't know in the Jewish non-profit world. I can say in the Israeli nonprofit world, certainly. But I imagine [that is the case], yes. I know that there are very few directors in the [Jewish] Federation system\xe2\x80\xa6 There are not enough women reaching higher positions.  Do you have any thoughts why that is happening, both in Israel and in the Diaspora, where there is this swath of workforce but very few are reaching the role that you have reached yourself?  I think it's like in every sector. The business sector has more and more women at the top, but it's still not equal. I think it's both the barriers that are always there: that people promote those who are like them and as long as men sit at the top it's very hard to [be more diverse]. But it will happen. It will happen.  And second of all it's also women deciding \xe2\x80\x94 and it's a decision \xe2\x80\x94 that you're willing to give up on some of the things that maybe you [wish you] didn't have to, like time with your children or time with your friends or other things \xe2\x80\x94 and deciding to give a lot of yourself to work, which is still needed.  We [at JDC] try to [allow] balance and to give more women the opportunity to advance \xe2\x80\x94 even if they want to be in the home. But their decision is part of it.  So it's not only a problem of women not being appointed, but it's actually the women themselves who don't necessarily want to commit to the lifestyle that one would need in order to reach this kind of position.  Yes, especially when you're young and raising a family, it's really a decision. I try to talk with my mother every day when I drive back home, just for 10 or 15 minutes, just to see how she's doing, and I say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, today was such a hard day.\xe2\x80\x9d And she says, \xe2\x80\x9cFor you, it's every day.\xe2\x80\x9d [laughs]  So it's also an internal decision, but I think that the labor market does have to change. I don't think that's a given. Part of our job as women who understand what [the work-life balance] means is to make sure that the labor market for directors allows for more flexibility.  I don't think it's a given that everyone who enters [the work force] needs to give up their lives, no, but now it's kind of like that.  Do you feel like you gave up quite a bit in order to reach the role that you are in today?  I reached it a little later in my life. But if you ask my children, I did. If you ask any children about any job, they'll say their mom wasn't there enough.  I just spoke with my youngest child who is 19. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember I never saw you, dad took me to school and a babysitter picked me up.\xe2\x80\x9d And those were the days that were easier. [laughs]  For me, I was many years in the university, I did my PhD and I wrote. So I kind of managed my days to work a lot after the children went to sleep and before [they got up]. I was lucky in that sense, a lot of my growth was within academia, which actually allows for flexibility.  And when I grew into managerial roles, my children were already a little older. So I experienced that [tension] less.  But now women are having children later and they want to be with them. And it's understandable and I think we all need to see \xe2\x80\x94 men and women \xe2\x80\x94 how we allow for the workplace to actually interact with life itself and balance it.  Especially for the young generation \xe2\x80\x94 they're smarter than us. They understand that they want a work-life balance and not everything is work, work, work, and work. And they're going to live for many years and they're going to change many jobs.  Some articles I've read talk about 14 changes throughout their lives for those who are entering the market now, so they understand that they're going to need a lot of strength coming from the home, from the children, enjoying that part of life. So I think we need to be part of changing that atmosphere.  How would you, in your position today, help somebody in your position 20 years ago, to become \xe2\x80\x9cyou.\xe2\x80\x9d  First and foremost, it's an internal understanding that you can. I had a good mentor. It was Alan Gill who headed the R&D department here and then after that headed JDC Global. I came to him and he asked me, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you need [from me], as a mentor?\xe2\x80\x9d  And I told him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I'm not really a manager, I've only managed a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d It was before I managed Tevet, the employment arm. And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I'm not a manager, I'm not going to help you with that. If you want help, you go to someone else,\xe2\x80\x9d and he gave me the name. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I'm going to help you be a leader at the Joint.\xe2\x80\x9d  That sentence alone opened my mind like nothing else did in terms of what I thought about my role in life, within the working environment. And I think a lot of women don't get that chance, for someone to just allow them to imagine themselves in that position.  That is mind-blowing: I will help you be a leader, not just a worker bee. I will help you be the queen bee. With that in mind, what kind of advice do you have for your daughters?  To my daughters [19 and 23] and also to my son [26], I say that they need to imagine themselves in a position where they can contribute the most to society and enjoy life. Because they will have a lot of life to live, so they need to study something that is flexible.  I'm a labor market person so I follow all the trends, so today, if you want to be able to support yourself financially, you need to study something that is both technological and has some kind of extra value in terms of ruach, in terms of humanities.  So take that base, do it \xe2\x80\x94 through university, through a coding bootcamp, whatever \xe2\x80\x94 but take it upon yourself to be strong in what you hold as your skills, and then open yourself up and think big, and don't be afraid."*[]*Steering the refitted ship into the future is new JDC Israel CEO, Dr. Sigal Shelach, a 50-something labor market firebrand who rose through the organization's ranks to become the first female head of the nonprofit's Israel wing.
